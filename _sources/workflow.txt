Patches
---------
Also referred to as a diff.

When an author has modified a file in a repository,
there is a difference (in terms of text lines and/or bytes changed)
between their local revision and
the repository revision they started with.
That's called a 'diff' or a 'patch'.

To share those changes, an author must submit a patch to
a repository maintainer, who is responsible for applying
or not applying the changes to a branch of a repository.

The patch review feedback cycle -- classically over NNTP or SMTP (email) --
can produce lots of text: both revisions to the patch and an
asynchronous stream of emails and IRC messages.

Patch attributes

Issues
--------

An issue records attributes of, notes regarding, and progress towards a finite request, report, or work item.

Issues are often also referred to as tickets, issues, cards, and bugtracking.

Agile methodologies for working with issues:

Pull Requests
--------------
Projects hosted with GitHub and BitBucket generally support accepting,
reviewing, and merging changes as pull requests; which, like
regular patches people used to send over the email,
are hunks of differences between one or more files.

Unlike a patch archived in a mailing list,
pull requests have
a free-form comment stream
and line-based commenting
-- features which simplify the change review and evaluation feedback loop.


Send a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Branch/fork, update, commit
* Compare, test (review diff)
* DOC: Prepend `Code Labels`_ to first line of patch header (commit message)
* Send a pull request

   * Email: Send a URL to the branch to pull from (tags: ``.tasks``, ``.code``, ``-waiting``)
   * GitHub: Click 'Send Pull Request'
   * BitBucket: Click 'Send Pull Request'

* Open Loop: ``-waiting`` for feedback


Review a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Open Loop: they're waiting for feedback
* Read, ReviewTest*, Respond
* Check whether the tests pass with the pull request applied
* Apply or do not apply

   * Do Not Apply

     * Send feedback: not interested, needs work

   * Apply

     * Update release log (See: `<#code-labels>`__)
     * Commit
     * Push



Lists
======

Mental
-------
* Mnemonics
* String around one's finger
* Note on one's hand
* Cognitive representation (mental picture) of a list
* Graph with edges that have magnitude

  + [ ] What: Project
  + [ ] When: Date recorded
  + [ ] Where: Location recorded
  + [ ] When: Date of task/event milestone
  + [ ] Where: Location for task/event milestone
  + [ ] What,Why,How: Description

Paper
------

Pros
~~~~~

.. epigraph::

    Just pick up a sheet of paper,
    write something down,
    and hand it to me.

* Classic, ubiquitous
* Visual
* Battery-free

Cons
~~~~~
.. epigraph::

    Ask ____ to ask _____ to have that sent over to _________.

Collaboration strategy:

* Backup: manual replication: scanner, copier, keyboard
* Sharing: who has which version of this sheet of paper?
* Synchrony: Correlating list status
* When: things were added/update/*renamed*/completed
* When,Why: Assigning and sorting by priority

and WikiText linking extensions.

* `GitHub Wiki`_ (Markdown, ReStructuredText)
* BitBucket Wiki (Markdown)
* Trac Wiki (Trac Wiki, ReStructuredText)
* wiki.python.org (MoinMoin)
* Wikipedia (Mediawiki)

Wikis are good for:

  * Links Pages, Outlines
  * Roadmaps, Todo lists

* Pandoc converts (sometimes lossily) between many wiki markup syntaxes


GitHub Wiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~
These ``.rst`` ReStructuredText files are maintained with a ``.rest``
extension to make it possible to edit these pages as both
a GitHub wiki and
a normal Sphinx git repository
manually published to a ``gh-pages`` branch.

    ENH: Add new feature (#1)
    BUG: Fixes #3
    DOC: index.rst: Add readme.rst
    TST: Extend tests for #1
    BLD,CLN: Makefile: remove extra newlines

* ``COMMA,DELIMITED, SET: of prefix labels``
* Three-characters, if possible

Code labels are helpful for:

* working with issue tracking tagging and labeling systems
* aggregating changes into release logs (``HISTORY``)
* correlating changes with requirements
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_traceability)

Tools
=======

pyrtm-task-cli
---------------
| Src: https://bitbucket.org/westurner/pyrtm-task-cli

A python CLI for working with tasks and pyrtm RememberTheMilk API.

Query/rename tasks in Python and generate a printable,
templated, minimal HTML `Hipster PDA`_
notebook-sized sheet of paper
of a list of tasks at one point in time.

workhours
----------
| Src: https://bitbucket.org/westurner/workhours

Aggregate streams of event tuples generated by various activity streams
(bookmarks, existing browser history, ``-usrlog`` files)


TaskWarrior
-------------
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskwarrior
| Homepage: http://taskwarrior.org/
| Src: https://git.tasktools.org/scm/tm/task.git
| Docs: http://taskwarrior.org/docs/
| Standard: http://taskwarrior.org/docs/design/task.html

TaskWarrior is a task management tool written in C with lots of plugins
written in other languages.

TaskWarrior comes with an awesome commandline interface for adding,
updating, and reporting on tasks, their statuses, and their priorities.

There are plugins to host and synchronize TaskWarrior task databases
(with TaskWarrior JSON: http://taskwarrior.org/docs/design/task.html).


Best Practices
============================
Project Templating
--------------------
- [ ] Generate a new project with templated packaging and documentation
  (e.g. with `<https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_)


Requirements Traceability
---------------------------

- [ ] Write a Roadmap wiki entry with links to Release Plans
  and/or issue milestones
  (`<git@github.com:westurner/wiki.wiki.git>`_ / ``Roadmap.rest``)

  * Roadmap wiki page: https://github.com/westurner/wiki/wiki/Roadmap
  * Milestone: https://github.com/westurner/wiki/milestones/0.1

- [ ] Write Features and *User Stories* as issues prefixed with ``ENH:``::

      ENH: Users can place orders

- [ ] Prefix commit messages with `Code Labels`_::

      TST: Create order placing tests
      DOC: Add order placing documentation
      BLD: Update the build configuration

- [ ] Link between **Issues**, **Commits**, **Pull Requests**, and
  *Release Logs* by referencing an issue number::

      TST: Create order placing tests (#123)
      DOC: Add order placing documentation (for #123)
      CLN: Cleanup syntax for style guide (#5678)

- [ ] Link between **Issues**, **Commits**, **Pull Requests**, and
  *Release Logs* by referencing (pasting) a link (URL, URI)
  as-is (with no anchor text)::

      https://github.com/westurner/wiki/issues/1


Revision Control

* [ ] Run tests before releasing
* [ ] Run tests before merging (e.g. Pull Request Webhooks)
* [ ] Run tests after merging. (e.g. HubFlow
  [``feature/*`` ->] ``develop`` ->
  ``release/v0.1.0`` -> ``master`` branch structure)
* [ ] Run tests before committing (while coding)
* [ ] Run tests when committing
  (with [required/local/central] repo event scripts)
* [ ] Write Tests First.
* [ ] Utilize Git HubFlow for managing project repository branches:
  ``develop``, ``master``, ``feature/*``, ``release/*``, ``hotfix/*``

  * https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/
  * https://westurner.org/tools/#git
  * https://westurner.org/tools/#hubflow

* [ ] Release semantic versions (`<http://semver.org>`_) tagged as
  ``major.minor.patch`` (e.g. ``v1.0.01``)

  * Semver 3.0 (Python PEP 440 version tag compatible):
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/pbr/semver.html

    * Python PEP 440
      "Version Identification and Dependency Specification"

      https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#examples-of-compliant-version-schemes

  * bumpversion https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion

- [ ] Include useful data (like version, revision, platform)
  in package filenames (and/or also create a JSON-LD metadata manifest):

  * e.g. ``westurner-wiki-v1.0.01-eb4df7f-linux64.whl``

  * Conda selectors: {``linux64``, ``py27``, ``py35`` }
    `<http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#preprocessing-selectors>`_
  * pbr (*Python Build Reasonableness*)
